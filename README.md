Yemen is facing one of the worldâ€™s worst Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) crises, as deteriorating WASH infrastructure contributes to a cholera outbreak, and represents one of the underlying causes of malnutrition in the country. 1
On behalf of the Yemen WASH Cluster, REACH coordinated a household-level assessment to provide an understanding of WASH needs, gaps, and priorities in 38 districts prioritized for famine and/or cholera interventions that also host a high concentration of Internally Displaced People (IDPs - 8% or more of the total district population). The prioritization of districts was done using 2017 data for 2018 intervention. 2 3

Findings are based on data collection conducted from 4 September to 28 November 2018. Following a two-stage random sampling approach, representative samples of host community and IDP populations were collected in randomly-selected locations in the 38 selected districts. Findings are representative at district level and population group(IDP/Host Community) with a 95% confidence level and a 10% margin of error. *

This dashboard provides an overview of the assessment data by indicator, disaggregated either by IDPs and host community households, or by head of household gender. District-level analysis facilitates the exploration of assessment results by district. 4
